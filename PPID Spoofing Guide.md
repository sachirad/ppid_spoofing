# PPID Spoofing Guide

1. First, download the code from the below GitHub repository.

2. Second, you need to compile the `ppid-spoof.c` file. For that, you need to install GCC in your system.

   - **Step 1**: Check whether you have GCC already installed by running:
     ```
     gcc --version
     ```
   - Continue the other steps only if GCC is not installed.

3. **Step 2**: To install GCC, download MSYS2 from [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/), install it, and open the MSYS2 terminal. Then run:

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc



4. **Step 3**: After installing GCC, add it to the System PATH:
- Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
- Click "Edit the system environment variables".
- Click "Environment Variables".
- Under System Variables, find "Path" and click "Edit".
- Click "New" and add:
  ```
  C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
  ```
- Click "OK" to save changes.
- Restart Command Prompt and verify by running:
  ```
  gcc --version
  ```

5. **Step 4**: Run the `compile.bat` file to compile `ppid-spoof.c`.

6. **Step 5**: After compilation, you will have a `ppid_spoofing.exe` file. Use it with the following command:

ppid_spoofing.exe <PPID> <EXE>
